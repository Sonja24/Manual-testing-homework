Task Board Test Management and Issue Tracker
Overview

This repository contains the documentation and artifacts for the "Task Board" exercise. The exercise focuses on test management and issue tracking for a Task Board application. You will work with two versions of the application:

    Task Board v.01: The initial version, which you will fork and test.
    Task Board v.02: The updated version after developer bug fixes, which you will re-test.

Your goals are to create comprehensive test cases in TestRail based on the provided SRS (Software Requirements Specification) for the Task Board application and to log any bugs you find in Jira.
